Some conclusions coming from this dataset:
- There is total of 8794 productions (1000 if we calculate episodes of a serie together)
- Movies dominate series, movies make up almost twice as much of the data as series. (If we calculate all episodes of a serie together as one position).
- Top 5 popular genres:
Dramas 
Comedies 
Action & Adventure 
Family & Kids Movies 
International TV Series 
Dramas and comedies are a significant portion of the offering. Content for kids and international series make up also a large share.
- Number of premieres has been growing gradually over the years but in 2015 we can see rise wich was part of a Netflix's strategic shift toward global dominance with expanding services to new markets, initially platform streames licensed content but shifted to own original content, and staying ahead in an increasingly competitive streaming market. Big jump in 2020 probably related to the pandemic and the greater demand for streaming content during that time. In 2021 number of premieres decreased, which may be due to production problems after the pandemic.
- United States leads in the number of productions, India on second position followed by United Kingdom almost tying with France.
- Oldest production on the platform is Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers, from 1925.
- The longest movie lasts 273 minutes (Headspace: Unwind Your Mind) and the shortest lasts 10 minutes (American Factory: A Conversation with the Obamas). TV-Serie Grey's Anatomy is the longest with 17 seasons. Most series lasts only one season.
