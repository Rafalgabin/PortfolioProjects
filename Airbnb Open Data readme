- Review Rate:
  * Staten Island, Bronx and Queens have the highest average review rates.
  * Manhattan has the lowest review rate.

- Number of reviews correlate with number of bookings, by this we can observe:
  * The number of reviews steadily increased from 2012 to 2019, peaking significantly in year 2019. A sharp decline in 2020 is visible likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its travel restrictions.
    Post-2020, reviews recovered but did not reach level from year 2019, slow rebound in travel. Recent years (2022â€“2024) show a gradual increase which indicate Airbnb activity is regaining momentum.
